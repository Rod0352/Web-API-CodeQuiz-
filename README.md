# Web-API-CodeQuiz-

### This is a Coding quiz project that utilizes JS, CSS, HTMl

 For this project I was tasked with creating a responsive quiz that lets
the user select from an array of answeres to prompted questions with the use of buttons.
A timer will show user the remaing time left to complete questions and users will be shown 
their score after being promted to enter intials. Scores a stored locally and are able to be cleared as well.
